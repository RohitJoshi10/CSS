      There are two types of length units: absolute and relative. <br /><br />
      1. The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of
      these will appear as exactly that size. Absolute length units are not
      recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However,
      they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
      eg:- cm, mm, in, px, pt, pc etc. <br /><br />

      2. Relative length units specify a length relative to another length
      property. eg:- <br /><br />
      (1) em: Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the
      size of the current font). <br />
      (2) ex: Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used) <br />
      (3) ch: Relative to width of the "0" (zero) <br />
      (4) rem: Relative to font-size of the root element <br />
      (5) vw: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport* <br />
      (6) vh: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport* <br />
      (7) vmin: Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension <br />
      (8)vmax: Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension (9) % Relative to
      the parent element. <br /><br />
      <b
        >Note:- Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly
        scalable layout! * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport
        is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm
