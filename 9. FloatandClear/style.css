/*
The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.
The float property can have one of the following values:
left - The element floats to the left of its container 
right - The element floats to the right of its container 
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default 
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent.
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.
*/

/*
When we use the float property,
and we want the next element below (not on right or left),
we will have to use the clear property.
The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element. 
The clear property can have one of the following values:
none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default 
left - The element is pushed below left floated elements 
right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements 
inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent
*/

/*
NOTE:- Only use float and clear property to float your text with the image.
